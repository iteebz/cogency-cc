# cogency-code

**A TUI coding agent built with cogency**

## Installation

```bash
poetry install
poetry run python -m cogency_code
```

## Vision

Minimal terminal interface that dogfoods cogency to build and improve itself.

## Extending the agent

The TUI intentionally keeps its agent factory fixed: `cogency_code.agent.create_agent` wires
in the standard identity, instructions, and security profile so every session behaves the
same way. If you need a custom pipeline, fork that function and swap in your own LLM,
security, or instructionsâ€”then point the Textual app at the new factory. Keeping the default
surface opinionated lets us evolve features deliberately while still leaving a clear hook for
experimentation.
